                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>Altair acquired Thea render in 2014 giving it access to industry leading visualization engine. <a href="https://www.thearender.com" target="_blank"> Thea render</a> is an award winning rendering and visualization product used by designers and architects.</p>
                            <p>One of the convergences after this acquisition was to bring in the capabilities of Thea into Inspire, our 3D modeling product.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>My contribution</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>I was tasked with redesigning the post processing interface for what we called "Darkroom" within Inspire.</p>
                            <p>The goal was to make it easy to compare, re-condition and animate frames on rendered images.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Inconsistencies</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>The initial implementation after acquisition did not give product temas enough time to conduct UX research. This led to a less than desired state.</p>
                            <p>I started by taking a closer look at the UI and talking to several customers who were beta testers for this product. The findings were not surprising.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The "Darkroom" UI did not feel like it was part of Altair family of products.</li>
                                <li>IA was sometimes illogical and confusing. Checkboxes were sometimes on the right, and sometiems on the left.</li>
                                <li>Iconography was inconsistent with other icons inside Inspire.</li>
                                <li>Several post processing tools such as applying filters had a steep learning curve.</li>

                            <p>I then laid out the journey map for the entire post processing workflow which included several sub-flows such as render now,render later and relight (a way to change lighting after image is rendered).</p>

                            <p>To better understand the accessibility of rendered and in-process image thumbnails, I had to redesign some image cards. These cards contained crucial information such as aspect ratio, type of rendering (full vs progressive) and current stage. We ran some tests in <a href="https://maze.co" target="_blank">Maze</a> to find the optimal solution with given set of constraints.</p>
