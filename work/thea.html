                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>Altair acquired Thea render in 2014 giving it access to industry leading visualization engine. Thea render is an award winning rendering and visualization product used by millions of designers.</p>
                            <p>One of the convergences was to bring in the capabilities of Thea engine into Inspire Studio, our 3D modeling product.</p>

                        <h2>My contribution</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>I was tasked with redesigning the post processing interface within Inspire Studio.</p>
                            <p>The goal was to make it easy to compare, re-condition and animate frames on rendered images</p>

                        <h2>Inconsistencies</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>The initial implementation done after acquisition did not allow for enough user experience research. This led to a less than desired state.</p>
                            <p>I started by taking a closer look at the UI and noting down these Inconsistencies.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The "Darkroom" UI was nothing like our design system Unity. It did not feel like it was part of Altiar.</li>
                                <li>IA was sometimes illogical.</li>
                                <li>Iconography was incorrect.</li>
                                <li>Several post processing tools such as applying filters had a steep learning curve.</li>
                             </ol>

                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>I then laid out the journey map for a typical post processing workflow which included several sub flows such as render now,render later, relight (a way to change lighting after image is rendered).</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>After testing a few layouts, I narrowed it down to a traditional post-processing style with the main image in front-left, with tools on the right and a timeline at the bottom.</p>

                            <p>To better understand the accessibility of rendered and in-process images, I had to redesign some image cards. These cards contained crucial information and we ran some tests to find the best solution with given set of constraints.</p>

                            <p>I proposed a brand new way of pre-applying and visualizing filters on the right side of the UI</p>
                            <p>This reduced the time required to find the right filter by 70%.</p>

                                    <li>A new horizontal image gallery that shows both queued and completed image thumbnails.</li>

                                    <li>13 new icons that align with our design system guidelines.</li>
