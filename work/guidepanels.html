                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>At Altair, we have been offering generative design to our customers since 2008.</p>
                            <p>Altair Inspire, launched in 2009 brought forward a completely new way to optimize 3D models. This was the first user experience focused <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization" target="_blank">Topology Optimzation</a> software on the market. The philosophy was to place the power of generative design into the hands of anyone, persona-agnostic. Now designers could run optimizations and produce amazing results.</p>

                        <h2>My contribution</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>I was tasked with creating a new way of capturing inputs for complex use cases. This involved both novel component design and brand new user-experience elements.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>As Inspire grew in complexity, we found ourselves dealing with complicated inputs for several tools. Existing methods of capturing inputs were getting quite hairy.</p>
                            <p>The "Guide-bar" introduced with Inspire was sufficient to capture inputs for most tools but became increasingly hard to handle for newer tools that required multiple inputs. It started causing fatigue.</p>
                            <p>In some cases, the guidebar flowed across the entire width of the modeling window, forcing users to traverse this distance to complete a task.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Solution</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>The strategy was to build out a fully atomic design system and this involved 3 steps:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Inventory existing components</li>
                                <li>Build components starting from fundamental atoms</li>
                                <li>Share design patterns with product teams</li>
                             </ol>
                            <p>As a team of one, I built the fundamental components, starting with defining color palette using <a href="https://leonardocolor.io" target="_blank">Leornardocolor</a> created by Nate Baldwin.</p>
                            <div class="project-images">
                                <img src="/images/unity/colors.jpg">
                            </div>
                            <p>Using figma variables, we defined global and alias tokens to ensure consistency</p>
                            <div class="project-images">
                                <img src="/images/unity/tokens.jpg">
                            </div>
                            <p>While building these components, we identified key product teams that were design evangelists. After setting up a formal ticketing, component request and fixing process, we rolled out the design system with a kickoff. It included an overview of the project, figma and its utility for our teams, the design system usage and guidelines.</p>
                            <p>Using the atomic approach, I built all templates to be fully self-sufficient and easily updatable. The resulting pattern library was extensive for the first launch, with over 200 components and 400 variants.</p>
                            <div class="project-images">

                            </div>
                            <p>This was a brand new initiative, and we were amazed with the response. We ensured the guides were clear and everyone was empowered to contribute to this new system.</p>

                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>The result of this new design system included increased sprint efficiency and velocity, higher organizational fluency, improved visibility for our team and last but not least quicker turnaround time for PMs and devs to implement powerful new features for our customers.</p>
