                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>At Altair, we have been offering generative design to our customers since 2008. Today, its called generative AI - same gift in new wrapping.</p>
                            <p>Altair Inspire, launched in 2009 brought forward a completely new way to optimize engineering models. This was the first user experience focused <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization" target="_blank">Topology Optimzation</a> software on the market. The brainchild of then CTO James Dagg, its goal was simple - to place the power of generative design into the hands of anyone, persona-agnostic.</p>
                            <p>Previously, mechanical engineers had the formal authority to optimize designs as it required domain expertise and optimization would come after prototyping testing. Inspire was shaking things up by bringing optimization sooner in the design pipeline.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>My contribution</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>I was tasked with creating a new way of capturing inputs. This involved both novel component design and brand new user-experience elements.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>As Inspire grew in complexity, we found ourselves dealing with inputs fatigue for several tools. Existing methods of capturing inputs were getting quite hairy.</p>
                            <p>The "Guide-bar" introduced with Inspire was sufficient to capture inputs for most tools but became increasingly hard to handle for newer tools that required multiple inputs.</p>
                            <p>In some cases, the guidebar flowed across the entire width of the modeling window, forcing users to traverse this distance to complete a task.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="project-images">
                            <img src="../images/guidepanels/guidepanel-ex1.jpg">
                            <figcaption class="captions">A guidebar example from the Contacts tool.</figcaption>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Challenges</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>This new method would be inherited across multiple products in our portfolio.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Understand and map typical and edge case workflows.</li>
                                <li>Improve the workflow while adhering to user expectations.</li>
                                <li>Design a scalable method that is easy to comprehend, intuitive and can be applied across workflows and across products.</li>
                             </ol>
                             <h2>Discovery</h2>
                            <p>I took an example of a tool called “extrude” and laid out the flow. I used the anchoring principle to carefully choose expected defaults. This came from both my own experience as a 3D modeler and data from informal interviews with other designers.</p>
                            <div class="project-images">
                                <img src="/images/guidepanels/discovery.png">
                                <figcaption class="captions">Mapping user journey for extrude</figcaption>
                            </div>
                            <p>Next step was to perform some competitor analysis and I landed on a top left to bottom down approach vs the existing left to right workflow. This changed the guidebar design to a panel one. I started exploring some options for information architecture.</p>
                            <div class="project-images">
                                <img src="/images/guidepanels/renditions-gp.jpg">
                                <figcaption class="captions">Mocks for IA inside guide panel</figcaption>
                            </div>
                            <p>Once required inputs are defined, additional options guide the user towards their final design. Here, I am looking at various sub-journeys that must be accommodated.</p>
                            <p>After talking with all stakeholders, we narrowed our design to a panel that satisfied the following criteria:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Clear primary workflow selection using tabs.</li>
                                    <li>Defined IA with group headers.</li>
                                    <li>Novel “entity selector” component.</li>
                                    <li>New methods for real time editing (toggle buttons instead of drop downs to save time).</li>
                                    <li>Mini guide bar to keep familiarity.</li>
                                    <li>Natural progression from top left to bottom right.</li>
                                </ol></p>

                            <p>The new guidepanel design was well received with over 20 teams adopting the design in first 6 months of delivery. During this redesign I also created a brand new entity selector component that made selecting multiple types of inputs in the same panel intuitive.</p>
