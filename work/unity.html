                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>Altair Design System, known internally as <em>Unity</em>, sits at the core of our organization, servicing a suite of software applications designed for simulation and high performance computing. It supports over 20 product teams by providing foundational elements and components, and acting as a platform for creating and maintaining design systems at Altair.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>My contribution</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>Strategy for design tokens, variable based theming, lead designer for core components, pattern library, release notes and contribution guides.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>When I joined the UI team in 2021, we were a small team of designers handling requests from around 5 product teams. Product Managers were using a mish mash of prototyping tools from word to balsamiq to create and share customer journeys for feature sets. Although we were closing tickets on time, we were unable to accomplish larger goals set for the team. There was no centralzied component library, patterns were unclear and usage was not fully documented.</p>
                            <p>From a business perspecitve, this was not good. We were efficiently inefficient. Our designs were neither sacalable nor sharable, and this made it difficult to expand our reach to new products and teams.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Solution</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>The strategy was to build out a fully atomic design system and this involved 3 steps:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Inventory existing components.</li>
                                <li>Build components starting from fundamental atoms.</li>
                                <li>Share design patterns with product teams and set them up for success.</li>
                             </ol>
                            <p>As a team of one, I started with the foundational elements - defining a color palette using <a href="https://leonardocolor.io" target="_blank">Leornardocolor</a> created by Nate Baldwin.</p>
                            <div class="project-images">
                                <img src="/images/unity/colors.jpg">
                                <figcaption class="captions">Colors from Loernardo</figcaption>
                            </div>
                            <p>Using figma variables, we defined global and alias tokens to ensure consistency</p>
                            <div class="project-images">
                                <img src="/images/unity/tokens.jpg" id="thea-resized">
                                <figcaption class="captions">Variables and tokens</figcaption>
                            </div>
                            <p>While building these components, we identified few design evangelists who were leading teams. After setting up a formal ticketing, component request and fixing process, we rolled out the design system with a kickoff. It included an overview of the project, figma and its utility for our teams, and design system usage and guidelines.</p>
                            <p>Using the atomic approach, I built templates to be self-sufficient and easily updatable. The resulting pattern library was extensive for the first launch, with over 200 components and 400 variants.</p>
                            <div class="project-images">
                                <img src="/images/unity/component.png" id="thea-resized">
                                <figcaption class="captions">A guide bar component</figcaption>
                            </div>
                            <p>This was a brand new initiative, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. PM's were excited to dive in and build. We ensured the guides were clear and every designer was empowered to contribute to this new system.</p>
                            <div class="project-images">

                        <h2>Outcome</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>The new design system increased our sprint efficiency, improved organizational fluency, and expanded our visibility as the core GUI team. Last but not least, quicker turnaround time for PMs and devs to implement powerful new features for our customers.</p>
