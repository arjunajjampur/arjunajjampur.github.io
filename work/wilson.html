                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>At Altair, we have been offering generative design to our customers since 2008.</p>
                            <p>Altair Inspire, launched in 2009 brought forward a completely new way to optimize 3D models. This was the first user experience focused <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization" target="_blank">Topology Optimzation</a> software on the market. The philosophy was to place the power of generative design into the hands of anyone, persona-agnostic. Now designers could run optimizations and produce amazing results.</p>

                        <h2>My contribution</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>I was tasked with creating a new way of capturing inputs for complex use cases. This involved both novel component design and brand new user-experience elements.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>As Inspire grew in complexity, we found ourselves dealing with complicated inputs for several tools. Existing methods of capturing inputs were getting quite hairy.</p>
                            <p>The "Guide-bar" introduced with Inspire was sufficient to capture inputs for most tools but became increasingly hard to handle for newer tools that required multiple inputs. It started causing fatigue.</p>
                            <p>In some cases, the guidebar flowed across the entire width of the modeling window, forcing users to traverse this distance to complete a task.</p>

                        <div class="project-images">

                        <h2>Challenges</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <!-- <p>Given the scope of this change that would affect multiple products in our portfolio, I wanted to understand the process.</p> -->
                            <ol>
                                <li>Understand and map typical and edge case workflows</li>
                                <li>Improve the workflow while adhering to user expectations</li>
                                <li>Design a scalable method that is easy to comprehend, intuitive and can be applied across workflows within the same system</li>
                             </ol>
                             <h2>Discovery</h2>
                            <p>I took an example of a tool called “extrude” and laid out the flow. I used the anchoring principle to carefully choose expected defaults. This came from both my own experience as a 3D modeler and data from informal interviews with other designers.</p>
                            <div class="project-images">
                                <img src="/images/guidepanels/discovery.png">
                            </div>
                            <p>Next step was to perform some competitor analysis and I landed on a top left - bottom down approach to input capture. This changed the guidebar design to a guide panel one. I started exploring some options for information architecture.</p>
                            <div class="project-images">
                                <img src="/images/guidepanels/renditions-gp.jpg">
                            </div>
                            <p>Once required inputs are defined, additional options guide the user towards their final design. Here, I am looking at various sub-journeys that must be accommodated.</p>
                            <p>After talking with all stakeholders, we narrowed our design to a panel that satisfied the following criteria:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Clear primary workflow selection using tabs</li>
                                    <li>Defined IA with group headers</li>
                                    <li>Novel “entity selector” component</li>
                                    <li>New methods for real time editing (toggle buttons instead of drop downs to save time)</li>
                                    <li>Mini guide bar to keep familiarity</li>
                                    <li>Natural progression from top left to bottom right</li>
                                </ol></p>

                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>The new guidepanel design was well received with over 20 teams adopting the design in first 6 months of delivery. During this redesign I also created a brand new entity selector component that made selecting multiple types of inputs in the same panel very easy.</p>
