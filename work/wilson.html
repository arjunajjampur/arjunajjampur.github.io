                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>I was part of <a href="https://www.golfpass.com/watch/driver-vs-driver" target="_blank">Wilson's Driver Vs Driver reality TV show</a> as an Industrial Design expert. It was a fantastic experience to be involved in a TV show, showcasing my entire design skillset from sketching, concept moldeing, visualization and branding.</p>
                            <p>The winner of this contest walked away with half a million dollars!</p>
                            <p>I walked away with a depth of expertise in golf clubs, a free driver and glowing skin - thanks to repeated applications of makeup.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>My contribution</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>I helped design the runner up driver "Pivot". The concept itself was submitted by Gavin Wallin, a contestant but I was tasked with taking a napkin sketch to a hittable prototype.</p>
                            <p>This concept contained a unique interchangeable weight system, that was revolutionary.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Competition</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>The season finale was a head to head between top two drivers - Pivot and Triton.</p>
                            <p>The cool thing was that my design would lose to Triton, the winning driver designed by my manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darren-chilton-2817596/" target="_blank">Darren Chilton</a>, a well-known Golf fanatic inside Altair.</p>
                            <p>Most of the details of this project is still under NDA but here are some comparisons between the top two drivers as we approached the season finale.</p>

                        <h2>Challenges</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>Golf drivers are extremely complex with highly precise geometry, both on the inside and outside. The <a href="https://www.usga.org/content/dam/usga/pdf/Equipment/Equipment%20Rules%20Final.pdf" target="_blank">USGA handbook</a> for equipment rules defines the constraints when designing drivers.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>For starters, every gram counts, the lighter you can make the head, the better.</li>
                                <li>User experience was important when designing interchangeable weights.</li>
                                <li>The surfaces had to be of high quality to facilitate smooth production, especially the fillets around edges and the transition from face to hosel.</li>
                             </ol>
                             <h2>Design</h2>
                            <p>Drivers have lowest loft angle in a golf set, they can hit far but not high. The design of the face had to be so precise that often it involved moving one or two points! Here is a list of golf driver KPIs.</p>
                            <div class="project-images">
                                <img src="/images/wilson/details.png">

                            </div>
                            <p>The driver is built by fusing 4 main parts - Crown, face, sole and hosel. Most drivers are made with titanium and towards the finale every 0.1g was important!</p>

                            <p>The show was held at Wilson HQ in the windy city of Chicago, and was one of the most interesting and challenging projects I have done so far.</p>
                            <p>Their incredible facility and supportive team gave me an opportunity to learn intricacies of golf club design.</p>
