                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>I was part of Wilson's Driver Vs Driver reality TV show as an Industrial Designer. It was a fantastic experience showcasing my design skillset from visualization to branding.</p>
                            <p>The winner of this contest walked away with half a million dollars for submitting a winning driver design.</p>

                        <h2>My contribution</h2>
                        <div class="project-desc">
                            <p>I helped design the runner up driver "Pivot". The concept itself was submitted by Gavin Wallin, a contestant</p>
                            <p>This concept contained a unique interchangeable weight system, that was revolutionary.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>The top two drivers were Pivot and Triton</p>
                            <p>Most of the details of this project is still under DNA but here are some comparisons between the top two drivers as we approached the season finale.</p>

                            <p>Golf drivers are extremely complex engineering feats with highly precise geometry both on the inside and outside. The <a href="https://www.usga.org/content/dam/usga/pdf/Equipment/Equipment%20Rules%20Final.pdf" target="_blank">USGA handbook</a> for equipment rules.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>For starters, every gram counts, the lighter you can make the head, the better</li>
                                <li>User experience was important when designing interchangaable weights</li>
                                <li>The surfaces had to be of high quality to facilitate smooth production</li>
                             </ol>
                             <h2>Design</h2>
                            <p>The drivers have lowest loft angle in a golf set. The design of the face had to be so precise that often it involved moving one or two points! Here is a list of golf driver KPIs.</p>

                                <img src="/images/wilson/details.png">
                            </div>
                            <p>The driver is built by fusing 4 main parts - Crown, face, sole and hosel. Most drivers are made with titanium and towards the finale every 0.1g was important!</p>

                            <p>The show was held at Wilson HQ in Chicago and was one of the most interesting and challenging projects I have done so far.</p>
                            <p>Their incredible facility and supportive team gave me an opportunity to learn intricacies of golf club design.</p>
