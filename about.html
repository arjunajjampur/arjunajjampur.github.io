                    <h1 class="timeline">THEN & NOW</h1>
                    <p class="desc">I started my career as a mainframe developer working for williams-sonoma. It was an era of outsourced software engineering jobs in India and my parents did their best to steer me towards a stable career.</p>
                        <p class="desc">However, I had always been sketching and painting and was keen to pursue a career in art and/or design.I moved to Sweden to study Industrial Design at <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/" target="_blank">Chalmers</a>.</p>
                        <p class="desc">In Sweden, my travails took me to Volvo and Lotus, where I completed internships in steering wheel design and suspension design. In my final year, I began exploring shapes in 3D using Alias and Rhino. My major was in <em>NURBS surface modeling</em>. My thesis was written at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/gyxUPTXWQvxaSims8" target="_blank">Mercedes Benz Design Studio</a> in Sindelfingen where I worked on <em>Neues Türöffnungskonzept</em> or New DoorOpening Concept for Mercedes Benz cars.</p>
                        <p class="desc">After graduation, I started working as a concept artist for a transportation startup in India. This was back when there was no venture funding, and we were self-funded, i,e sweat and tears. I was wearing many hats - from designing vehicle interfaces and presenting to clients, to paying electricity bills and running miscellaneous errands.</p>
                        <!-- <h1 class="timeline">NOW</h1>     -->
                        <p class="desc">My latest gig has been with <a href="https://www.altair.com" target="_blank">Altair</a> where I started as an Industrial Design subject matter expert (SME) for a 3D/CAD tool.</p>
                        <p class="desc">Over the past decade, I have had the pleasure of working with amazing designers from firms such as <a href="https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/" target="_blank">UnderArmour</a>, <a href="https://www.tervis.com" target="_blank">Tervis</a>, <a href="https://www.wilson.com/en-us/golf" target="_blank">Wilson Golf</a>, <a href="https://www.dimensionsfurniture.com" target="_blank">Dimensions Furniture</a>, to name a few.</p>
                        <p class="desc">In 2021, I helped build and launch Altair Design System -<em>Unity</em>. Today, we have wide spread adoption and are working on V 2.0 of Unity that utilizies design tokens and variables.</p>
