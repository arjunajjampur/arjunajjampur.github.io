                    <p>I apporach design challenges with three important things in mind:</p>

                                    <h3>Frame and Reframe</h3>
                                    <div class="process-desc">
                                        <p>I strive to find simple solutions to complex problems. This begins with clear and intentional communication with all stakeholders. How many times have we ended up with a design that was infeasable? Understanding the problem well, minimizes rework.</p>
                                        <p>As a fan of Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) approach, I like to <strong>ask why to go up one level and how to go down one level. </strong> <em>Why?</em> will tell you the reason a problem exists and be the north start for your decisions. On the other hand, <em>How?</em> will tell you the current approach and help ideate a new way forward.</p>
                                        <p>Sure, there are many different approaches that come and go over time but I think the names matter less, the takeaways are more important.</p>
                                        <p>It is akin to <strong>measure twice, cut once</strong>.</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                    <h3>Outcome over Output</h3>
                                    <div class="process-desc">
                                        <p>My job is <strong>not</strong> to eliminate all friction and create large number of outputs, but to create clear, intuitive experiences that result in a better outcome for <s>users</s> <strong>people</strong>.</p>
                                        <p>In the world of KPIs, OKRs,.etc, it is a good idea to measure what you are delivering in terms of <strong>Impact</strong>. Of course it is important to deliver quality content and sometimes we need many frames to communicate a design, but there should be a follow up measurement - How did this work in the real world? How was the user impacted?</p>
                                        <p>Always ask, <strong>So what?</strong></p>

                                    <div class="process-desc">
                                        <p>As a designer, I like to spend time in a <strong>silo</strong>. Today, one must look beyond their team and see where their subunit fits in the broader organizational context.</p>
                                        <p>When the market booms, everyone is riding the revenue hype train. When ther market cools, focus shifts to profits and margins. How does your team contribute to the margin? Is it a cost center? Can you cut costs in a downturn and be nimble? Even better, can we find optimizations to boost our bottom line irrespective of state of the market?</p>
                                        <p>If not, <strong>why bother?</strong></p>
