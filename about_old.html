                        <h2>My Story</h2>
                        <p class="desc">I started my career as a <strong>forced developer</strong>. It was the era of outsourced software engineering jobs in India and my parents did their best to steer me towards a stable career.</p>
                        <p class="desc">However, I had always been sketching and painting and was keen to pursue a carreer in art & design.I moved to Sweden to study Industrial Design at <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/" target="_blank">Chalmers</a>. Sorry, mom & dad.</p>
                        <p class="desc">In Sweden, my travails took me to Volvo and Lotus, where I did internships in steering wheel design and suspension design. In my final year, I began exploring shapes in 3D using Alias and Rhino. My major was in <em>NURBS surface modeling</em>. My thesis was written at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/gyxUPTXWQvxaSims8" target="_blank">Mercedes Benz Design Studio</a> in Sindelfingen where i worked on <em>Neues Türöffnungskonzept</em> or New DoorOpening Concept for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_SLS_AMG" target="_blank"> Mercedes Benz SLS AMG</a>.</p>
                        <p class="desc">After graduation, I started working as a concept artist for a transportation startup in India. I was wearing many hats- from illustrator to Class A modeler. One of India's first concept car was the <em>Scarab</em> and I was one of the lead designers.</p>
                        <p class="desc">My latest gig has been with <a href="https://www.altair.com" target="_blank">Altair</a> where I started as an Industrial Design subject matter expert (SME) for a 3D/CAD tool. After working with designers for several years, I realized the impact of user expereince on software design.</p>
                        <p class="desc">In 2021, I helped build and launch Altair Design System -<em>Unity</em>. Today, we have wide spread adoption and are working on V 2.0 of Unity, that utilizies design tokens and variables.</p>
